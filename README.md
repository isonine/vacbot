# vacbot
script that creates oddshot every time when at least 100 users says "VAC" in the Twitch chat

Just paste contents of vacbot.js to chrome dev console on stream tab and hit enter. Followers info under stream will be replaced with VAC: <count> and when count reaches over 100, script will click on Oddshot button (you need Oddshot chrome extension)
